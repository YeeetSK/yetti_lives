# Yetti Limited Life(s)
Ever wanted to make player's lifes more valuable? If yes, then this is your option. By this script, you can limit the amount of times a player can respawn, count their life(s) spent, kind of like a cat... You can place the event to remove a life anywhere on the server side, if you wan't to remove life(s) for example when being sent to prison. This makes the players think twice before going into a shoot out, or jumping from a hill.
